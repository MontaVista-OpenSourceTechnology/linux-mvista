XILINX AXI ETHERNET Device Tree Bindings
--------------------------------------------------------

Also called  AXI 1G/2.5G Ethernet Subsystem, the xilinx axi ethernet IP core
provides connectivity to an external ethernet PHY supporting different
interfaces: MII, GMII, RGMII, SGMII, 1000BaseX. It also includes two
segments of memory for buffering TX and RX, as well as the capability of
offloading TX/RX checksum calculation off the processor.

Management configuration is done through the AXI interface, while payload is
sent and received through means of an AXI DMA controller. This driver
includes the DMA driver code, so this driver is incompatible with AXI DMA
driver.

For more details about mdio please refer phy.txt file in the same directory.

Required properties:
- compatible	: Must be one of "xlnx,axi-ethernet-1.00.a",
		  "xlnx,axi-ethernet-1.01.a", "xlnx,axi-ethernet-2.01.a"
		  for Axi Ethenret 1G MAC
		  controllers and "xlnx,ten-gig-eth-mac" for Axi
		  Ethernet 10G MAC controllers.
- reg		: Address and length of the IO space.
- interrupts	: Should be a list of two interrupt, TX and RX.
- interrupt-parent	: Must be core interrupt controller.
- phy-handle	: Should point to the external phy device.
		  See ethernet.txt file in the same directory.
- local-mac-address	: See ethernet.txt file in the same directory.
- phy-mode		: see ethernet.txt file in the same directory.

Optional properties:
- xlnx,rxmem		: Max Rx Memory size.
- xlnx,txcsum		: Checks for tx checksum.
- xlnx,rxcsum		: Check for rx checksum.
- xlnx,phy-type		: Phy device type.
- dma-coherent		: For ACP port designs to allocate cohernet memory.
- xlnx,eth-hasnobuf	: Used when 1G MAC is configured in non processor mode.

Example:

	axi_ethernet_eth_buf: axi-ethernet@44a00000 {
			axistream-connected = <&axi_dma_1>;
			compatible = "xlnx,axi-ethernet-buffer-2.0",
				      "xlnx,axi-ethernet-1.00.a";
			reg = <0x44a00000 0x40000>;
			interrupt-parent = <&microblaze_1_axi_intc>;
			interrupts = <4 2>;
			local-mac-address = [00 0a 35 00 00 00];
			phy-handle = <&phy0>;
			phy-mode = "sgmii";
	}
