title: PTN5150 CC (Configuration Channel) Logic device

maintainers:

description: |
  PTN5150 is a small thin low power CC logic chip supporting the USB Type-C
  connector application with CC control logic detection and indication
  functions.  It is interfaced to the host controller using an I2C interface.

properties:
  compatible:
    const: nxp,ptn5150

  int-gpios:
    deprecated: true
    description:
      GPIO pin (input) connected to the PTN5150's INTB pin.
      Use "interrupts" instead.

  interrupts:
    maxItems: 1

  reg:
    maxItems: 1

  vbus-gpios:
    description:
      GPIO pin (output) used to control VBUS. If skipped, no such control
      takes place.

  irq-is-id-quirk:
    description:
      The PTN5150 has an open drain output, ID, that is driven low when a
      UFP is attached. ID is pulled high by an external resistor when either
      1) no cable is attached or 2) a DFP is attached.

      For designs that do not connect the PTN5150 IRQ, this boolean allows
      using the ID output as an IRQ by triggering on falling and rising edges.

      A falling edge indicates a UFP is attached (e.g. flash drive). Change
      to host mode using usb_role_switch_set_role.

      A rising edge indicates the UFP is removed. Prepare for when a DFP
      is connected by changing to device mode using usb_role_switch_set_role.

      This is useful because it allows a single device tree to support
      the following:

      Variscite's Symphony board <= 1.4 connects the PTN5150 IRQ pin to
      a GPIO on the SoM. Starting in Symphony board >= 1.4a, to allow
      compatibility with all Variscite i.MX8 SoMs, PTN5150 ID pin is
      instead connected to the same GPIO on the SoM.
